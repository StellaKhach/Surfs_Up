# Surfs_Up
# Overview of Analysis
Deliverable 1 
We use SQLAlchemy to connect the query to a database. 
Write a query that uses the measurements table to filter data and temperatures. In the first deliverable, 
we used the month of June.
The temperatures are to be added to a list. We then confert the list to Pandas DataFrame and generate the summart statistics.
For deliverable 2, similar to Deliverable 1, this time we filter the data column in the measurements table for the month of 
December. Lastly, design a flask application using the data. 

The purpose of this assignment was to help an investor beter decide if he should build a Surf and Ice Cream shop in Hawaii. He is concerned about the weather impacting his business, where percipitation would force him to close the shop early and frequently. 


# Results
In June, we see that the mean temperature is about 75 degrees. In December, we see that the mean temperature is 71 degrees but it has a higher rate of percipitation.  The perciptiation has higher inches in December than in June.

# Summary
Using the data and graphs, we can see that the difference between December and June are reasonably close. The reason we used June and December was to see the semi-annual weather at both extremes of the year. Although slightly more precipitation is anticipated in December, we see that the steady patters support opening a year-round Surf and Ice Cream shop.
